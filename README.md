Cartoonize Images using Pix2Pix GAN
This project aims to transform real-world images into cartoon-style images using a Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). It includes dataset preparation, training, and testing of the model, along with a demo on new images and videos.

Overview
This repository contains the following:

A dataset of paired images (real <> cartoonized).
Scripts for image stylization using OpenCV.
Implementation of Pix2Pix GAN for image-to-image translation.
Results validation on test datasets and new images/videos.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is based on the Scenery Watermarks Dataset from Kaggle.

Modifications: The dataset was processed using OpenCV to create cartoonized versions of the original images.
You can download the original dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory as follows:
php

data/
├── train/
│   ├── real/         # Original images from the dataset
│   └── cartoon/      # Cartoonized versions created with OpenCV
├── test/
│   ├── real/
│   └── cartoon/
Features
Cartoonization of images using OpenCV for dataset creation.
Training a Pix2Pix GAN to perform real-to-cartoon image translation.
Validation on unseen images and video input.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cartoonize-images.git
cd cartoonize-images
Install dependencies:

bash
Copier le code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download and prepare the dataset:

Download the original dataset from Kaggle.
Use the scripts/ folder to stylize real images into cartoon-style images.
Ensure the dataset follows the format shown above.
Train the Pix2Pix model:

bash

python train_pix2pix.py --dataset_path data/train
Test the model on new images:

bash

python test_pix2pix.py --input_path data/test/real --output_path results/
Demo on a video:

bash

python demo_video.py --input_video input.mp4 --output_video cartoonized_output.mp4
Results
Sample Outputs:

Input Image	Cartoonized Output
Validation Metrics:

Adversarial Loss: value
L1 Loss: value
